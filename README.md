# GPA Genie - COMP 496 - Senior Project 2
This repository houses the Senior Project that my group completed for COMP 496 Spring 2022.

## Description
The GPA Genie is a one-stop stop for a student’s academic progress. It can pull up a student’s GPA with
just one click. It can also allow students to manually add anticipated grades to the system and generate
the anticipated GPA. It can also tell whether students are on track for academic recognition (such as
Dean’s List), on track for maintaining Good Standing, and on track for keeping scholarships. We hope
that our tool can help students take the guesswork out of their GPA and to take control of their academic
careers.
